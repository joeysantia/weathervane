# weather-app

This is a weather app, which fetches information from the OpenWeatherMap One Call API. This is my first project that uses asynchronous JavaScript. This project also uses form validation through catching errors in the asynchronous JavaScript (i.e. fetching errors are displayed as form validation errors).
